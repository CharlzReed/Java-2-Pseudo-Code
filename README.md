# Java-2-Pseudo-Code
Converts Java code into Pseudo Code. It is NOT perfect, but it still does a lot of the work. It works best when the code is cleanly written.

See the "sample.java" and "converted.txt" files to get an idea of what it is able to do.

INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE:
All you have to do is put your project file or folders into the same directory as the python file, and after running it, a folder labelled “output” will appear with all of the pseudocode txt files for every “.java” file inside the current directory and all nested directories.
